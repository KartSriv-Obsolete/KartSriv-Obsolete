Hey, <br>
**If you have lost access to any of my repositories, it could be because of the fact that I have migrated certain repos to a different account.** The reason for the migration is because I have accumulated hundreds of repositories over the years and it's becoming very tedious to manage them. Hence I've come up with this workaround. Any inconvenience caused is regretted.

To regain access to a repo, please change the username to the following based on the criteria.
- If the repo is less than a month old then change the username to [@KartSriv](https://www.github.com/KartSriv)
- If the repo is less than 2 years old then change the username to [@KartSriv-Personal](https://www.github.com/KartSriv-Personal)
- If the repo is older than 2 years then change the username to [@KartSriv-Obsolete](https://www.github.com/KartSriv-Obsolete) <br>
*If you still haven't regained the access, it's most probably because I might have deleted the repository though feel free to [contact me](mailto:help@kartsriv.com).* <br>
Thanks <3 <br>
Karthik <br>
